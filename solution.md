    - For the Input we use a input tag with the type "range" wich will be then a slider
    - each of the sliders gets a label with a "for" attribute to make the relation between 
    the Slider and its label / Text more exessable for the user. 
    - the area that represents or shows the color is going to be a div. that takes up the remaining space from the vieport.
